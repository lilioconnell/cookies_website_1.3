    <p  ID="Story"> In 2013, I visited New York, and on that trip took a stop at the world famous Levain Bakery. I had a chocolate chip cookie and to this day, it has not been topped by any other.  </p>
    <p> I am going to be attempting to recreate these cookies by using a recipe I found online claiming to taste almost the exact same. I am excited to see if they will taste the same as the original and the differences between the two. Here you will find the step by step method and results! </p>
    <p ID="Recipe"> The ingredients in this recipe are 115 grams unsalted butter, 190 grams brown sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 large egg, 245 grams plain flour or all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, Pinch of salt, optional, 225 grams dark chocolate, *optional* 50 grams of walnuts. Feel free to follow along at home! *Note* I chose to opt out of using walnuts as I am not a fan of their flavour </p>
